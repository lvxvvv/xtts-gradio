The sky is not typically red. It appears blue to our eyes due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere.\n\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than the longer (red) wavelengths, resulting in the blue color we see in the sky during the daytime. This is why the sky appears blue, not red.\n\nHowever, there are some situations where the sky can appear to be red:\n\n1. Sunsets and sunrises: During these times, the sun's light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths of light even more. This leaves mainly the longer wavelengths (red and orange) to reach our eyes, making the sky appear reddish.\n2. Dust storms or pollution: When large amounts of dust or pollutants are suspended in the air, they can scatter light in a way that gives the sky a reddish hue.\n3. Atmospheric conditions: Certain atmospheric conditions, such as high levels of aerosols or water vapor, can also cause the sky to appear red or orange.\n\nIn summary, the sky is typically blue due to Rayleigh scattering, but it can appear red during specific situations such as sunsets, dust storms, or other atmospheric conditions.
